Rubberfuse
==========

Rubberhose cryptography.

This is HIGHLY experimental cryptographic software, do not rely on it for strong security/anonymity. Using this software is at your own risk. It is intented for testing and development and not peer-reviewed in any way.

Currently we will only focus on a linux build, we might port it to other platforms in the future.
