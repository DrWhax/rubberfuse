= Introduction =

A Rubberhose-fs clone, which has not seen active work since Linux 2.2. (See http://marutukku.org/ for the original project).
Rubberfuse aims to provide deniable encryption.

Motivation behind this project would be to have a decent secure file system, where oppressors and adversaries can't determine whether a file system
has multiple encrypted partitions. This is very useful in oppressive countries like Burma, Iran and Belarus.

The initial rubberhose prototypes will use FUSE. For system with better
performance and a secure implementation we may switch to device mapper
instead.

If you would like to know more about the project, visit our IRC channel and
subscribe to the mailing list.

= Planning =

Work on the project has started; we have been reading some papers and
documentation of rubberhose as well as related work.

More up-to-date information can be found on the github source repository.

= Current Status =

We have finished a small fuse prototype with support for one aspect; the next
step will be to add support for multiple aspects, larger master blocks and add
support for encrypting the blocks using the nettle library.

= Architecture =

= Planned Features =

* Multiple containers
* Plausible deniability

= Future work =

* Porting to portable devices? (Android/Meego) Not iOS, that's only for hipsters.

= Repository =
* https://github.com/techinc/rubberfuse
* https://github.com/MerlijnWajer/rubberfuse

= IRC =
We idle and occasionally talk at: irc.freenode.net #rubberfuse

= Mailinglist =
Users can subscribe to our list by sending an email to
rubberhose-request@freelists.org with 'subscribe' in the Subject field OR by
visiting our list page at http://www.freelists.org/list/rubberhose

= Things we need to investigate =

* What are recent advances in filesystem and storage technology which could benefit this project?
* Find out if certain security measures in Rubberhose are outdated and see if we can add new ones.

= Brainstorm =
